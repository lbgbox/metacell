\arguments{
\item{mc2d_id}{2d object to add}

\item{mc_id}{meta cell id to work with}

\item{graph_id}{graph_id of the similarity graph on cells from the metacell. This should always be specified, even if an mgraph is supplied since we use the obejct to position cells releative to metacels}

\item{mgraph_id}{mgraph_id of the metacell graph to use. If this is null the function will compute an mgraph itself using the cell graph}

\item{ignore_mismatch}{determine if mismatch in mc names are to be ignored.}

\item{feats_gset}{gene set name for use in parametric graph and/or umap 2d projection}

\item{feats_exclude}{list of genes to exclude from the features gene set}

\item{graph_parametric}{if this is True, mc edges will be determined using parametric distances and not the cells k-nn graph.}

\item{logist_loc}{the location parametr of the logistic function used to determine parametric distances between metacelles}

\item{logist_scale}{the lscale parametr of the logistic function used to determine parametric distances between metacelles}

\item{symetrize}{should the mc confusion matrix be symmetrized before computing layout?}
